    <h2>CIVIL ENGINEERING</h2>
    <p> Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways</p>
    

    <p class="w3-small"> The objective of the B.Tech graduate program in Civil Engineering is to give the understudies great comprehension of civil engineering arrangements in a global, societal and ecological setting, steady with the standards of sustainable improvement. The course will make the understudies capable Identifying, planning and taking care of civil engineering problems that meet indicated execution, cost, time, well being and other quality needs and objectives with proficient and moral responsibility.The department also offers two PG programs, M. Tech. in Structural Engineering and M.Tech. in Construction Technology under full time category.</p>

    <td>Surveying Laboratory</td>
    <td>
        <p class="w3-small">The planning and design of all Civil Engineering projects such as construction of highways, bridges, tunnels, dams etc. are based upon surveying measurements. Moreover, during execution, project of any magnitude is constructed along the lines and points established by surveying. Thus, surveying is a basic requirement for all Civil Engineering projects. . </p>
