    	<h4>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</h4>
    	<p class="w3-small">Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems</p>
    
    	<p class="w3-small">The aim of the mechanical engineering is to create a flexible undergraduate educational experience in <ul> <li>design</li><li> mathematics modeling</li><li> computing</li> <li>management</li><li> engineering science</li><li> humanities and social sciences</li></ul>. The students completing their B.Tech course are fully prepared for technological career in industry as well in further post-graduate or management courses. The students can also utilize these interdisciplinary programs as an initiation for professional careers in business or public service sectors.The department organizes corporate training programs, besides undertaking industrial consultancy. This imparts immense benefit to students by way of good placements, well-equipped computational laboratories with required software and industrial exposure.</p>
