    <h2>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h2>
    <p>Computer engineering combines the fields of electrical engineering and computer science. A computer engineer is involved in both the design of computer architecture and the design of hardware and software.</p>

    <p class="w3-small"> It is a four years (eight semester) full-time undergraduate program. Out of eight semesters, seven semesters are dedicated to in house study involving course work and projects. Final semester is dedicated to Industrial Project. Students spend entire eighth semester in an IT company and do a project.The curriculum is designed by keeping industrial and research needs, as well as the rapid development in the IT industry. Flexibility in curriculum is provided through Electives, Seminars and Projects. The program is supported by well-equipped laboratories consisting of the state-of-the-art servers & computers.There are well qualified and experienced academic staffs. Almost all of them are actively involved in research. This creates a lively and stimulating atmosphere to study Computer Engineering. The Faculty members publish their research work in national and international journals and conferences. Students routinely present Technical Papers at National Level Symposiums, and achieve laurels.To give more and more industrial exposure to students, the department has strong industry interface with leading companies like<ul> <li class="w3-small">IBM</li><li class="w3-small"> CISCO</li><li class="w3-small"> INFOSYS</li><li class="w3-small"> ORACLE</li><li class="w3-small"> NVIDIA</li> <li class="w3-small"> MICROSOFT</li></ul>. This helps to ensure that department’s research and teaching is well informed and relevant to the needs of society.</p>
